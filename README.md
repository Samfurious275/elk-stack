 Project Summary: ELK Stack Integration with Nginx Logs on Kubernetes

Overview:

This project demonstrates the implementation of an  ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)  on  Kubernetes , integrated with  Nginx  to collect, process, and visualize application logs in real time. The entire setup was deployed using  Helm charts , ensuring modularity, scalability, and reusability. Filebeat was used as a log shipper to forward Nginx logs into Elasticsearch via Logstash, and Kibana was configured for visualization and analysis.

  

 Key Objectives:

    • Deploy the ELK Stack on Kubernetes using Helm.
    • Integrate Nginx logs into the ELK Stack for centralized logging.
    • Use Filebeat to collect and forward Nginx logs to Elasticsearch via Logstash.
    • Visualize logs in Kibana for real-time monitoring and analysis.
    • Ensure smooth deployment and configuration using Helm charts.

  

   Architecture & Components: 

1.  Kubernetes Deployment
 
All components were deployed on a local Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube) using Helm charts. The Helm chart structure is as follows:




2.  ELK Stack Components

    • Nginx Service :
    1. Deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment or DaemonSet.
    2. Logs are generated by the Nginx container.

    • Filebeat : 
    1. Deployed as a DaemonSet to run alongside the Nginx pods.
    2. Configured to collect logs from the Nginx containers and forward them to Elasticsearch.
 
    • Elasticsearch :
    1. Deployed as a StatefulSet with persistent storage to ensure data durability.
    2. Exposed via a ClusterIP for internal communication and NodePort service for external communication.
 
    • Kibana :
    1. Deployed as a Deployment with a NodePort service to expose it externally for visualization. 



   3.  Nginx Integration 
    • Nginx was deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster.
    • Logs generated by Nginx containers were collected via Filebeat.
    • Logs were processed by Logstash and indexed into Elasticsearch.

  

   Implementation Details:

    1. Helm Chart Deployment 
The Helm chart was used to deploy all components of the ELK Stack:

    • Elasticsearch : Deployed as a StatefulSet with persistent storage.
    • Logstash : Configured to consume logs from Kafka (or directly from Filebeat).
    • Kibana : Exposed via a NodePort service for external access.
    • Filebeat : Deployed as a DaemonSet to collect Nginx logs.

   2. Filebeat Configuration 
Filebeat was configured to:

    • Collect logs from Nginx containers.
    • Forward logs to Logstash.
    • Use dynamic discovery to monitor Nginx pods.



    3. Logstash Configuration 
Logstash was configured to:

    • Consume logs from Filebeat.
    • Parse and enrich logs before forwarding them to Elasticsearch.



    4. Kibana Visualization 
Kibana was configured to:

    • Connect to Elasticsearch via the internal service.
    • Create index patterns to map the log data structure.
    • Build dashboards and visualizations to monitor Nginx logs in real time.














   Visual Verification 
You have captured key evidence of successful deployment:






  

   Key Achievements:
    • Successfully deployed and configured the  ELK Stack using Helm charts .
    • Integrated  Filebeat with Nginx logs  for centralized logging.
    • Set up a  real-time log streaming pipeline : Nginx → Filebeat → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana.
    • Validated deployment through CLI commands and UI tools.
    • Created reusable Helm chart for future deployments.

  

Tools & Technologies Used: 
    • Kubernetes  (Minikube)
    • Helm  (for packaging and deployment)
    • Docker 
    • ELK Stack : Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
    • Filebeat 
    • Nginx 
    • Linux Terminal (Ubuntu) 

  



  

 Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrated the integration of the ELK Stack with Nginx logs in a Kubernetes environment. Key highlights include:
    • Smooth deployment of all components using Helm charts.
    • Real-time log collection and processing using Filebeat and Logstash.
    • Centralized log storage and indexing in Elasticsearch.
    • Interactive log visualization in Kibana.
